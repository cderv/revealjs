# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

# Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

# Slide with R Code and Output

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

# Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

# Vertical slides

Slides can be nested inside of each other. 

Use the Space key to navigate through all slides. Or the arrow key.

## Basement Level 1

Nested slides are useful for adding additional detail underneath a high level horizontal slide.

## Basement Level 2

That's it, time to go back up. 

Keep pressing the Space key to go to next horizontal slide.

# Insert an image on the whole slide

```
# Slide background {data-background-color="#33ffd8"}

This slide has another background changed using `data-background-color`. 

Next vertical slides show variants

Which will be used in whole background

## Using an image 2 {data-background-image="https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg" data-background-repeat="repeat" data-background-size="100px"}

## Using a gif {data-background-image="https://media4.giphy.com/media/vKHKDIdvxvN7vTAEOM/giphy.gif" data-background-size="contain" data-background-repeat="no-repeat"}
